## **TechStack**

For this project, I decided to utilize React and Three.js for the frontend. I’ve been interested 3d animations and I found Three JS, a library that uses WEBGL for 3d rendering, and used it to render the distorting sphere on the home page.

## **Components**

When creating my website, I noticed that there were a lot of repeating elements, such as the project cards in the Projects section. To reduce code redundancy and make editing easier in the future, I created a custom card component that takes in the fields for the project card as parameters. This allows me to edit or create new project cards by simply changing the parameters being passed.

## **Feedback Form**

I wanted a way to get people’s thoughts and feedback about the website as it was newly made. So I implemented a form using Firebase and set up a simple Firestore Database that stores the name and the feedback from each response.

## **Design**

Before starting code, I made sure to wireframe some screens on Figma to establish a robust and responsive design. I spent my time refining the colors, the text, and the layout to reflect my brand and to showcase my projects and skills.
